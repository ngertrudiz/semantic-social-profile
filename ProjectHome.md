Semantic Social Profile introduces the flexible way of connecting the social extensions of MediaWiki and Semantic MediaWiki annotations. It is an extension that represents information in the social profile in a format suitable for Semantic Mediawiki queries. It also represents all the information in user profiles in RDF and FOAF so now you will be able to create and edit your profile once in MediaWiki and export it anywhere in RDF.
